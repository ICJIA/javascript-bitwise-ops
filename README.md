# JavaScript Bitwise Operations Demo

Interactive demonstration of JavaScript bitwise operations. It allows users to input a number, select a bitwise operation, and see the result in both decimal and binary formats. It also provides explanations and use cases for each operation.

Why Bitwise operations? They are fundamental in programming, especially in low-level programming, performance optimization, and certain algorithmic challenges. This project aims to make understanding these operations easier through interactive examples.

## Features

- Interactive demonstration of bitwise operations
- Clear explanations of each operation
- Visual representation of binary numbers

## How to Use

1.  Enter an integer in the input field.
2.  Select a bitwise operation from the available buttons.
3.  The result will be displayed in both decimal and binary formats, along with an explanation of the operation.
